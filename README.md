# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

  Up now i learned how to use React Route and how to call neste Route in a file with the help of the Outlet element. Inted of useState, in real apps we store data in the IP address of the app. Ex: localhost:5173/app/countries; 5173 is the address of the vite project, /app is the app page of the project and /countries is the nested Route that appears in the app page displaying the countries/ cities in the sidebar.
